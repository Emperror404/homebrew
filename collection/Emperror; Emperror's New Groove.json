The spell copies only nonmagical text, not illustrations or magical writings (such as the text of a spellbook or a spell scroll). If the target contains normal and magical writing (such as a letter with a glyph of warding), only the normal text is copied, leaving blank space in the copied text where the magical writing would be expected. Likewise, if the target contains text and illustration, only the text is copied.",

If more pages in the target exist than blank pages are available, the spell copies the original until it runs out of blank pages. At any time during the spell's duration you can redirect the magic to copy from another target, copy onto a different blank source, or resume a duplication that was interrupted by a shortfall of blank pages.",

After a close call with a wererat, Gentrus decided to leave Luskan for the safety of Icewind Dale, joining a caravan traveling north.
